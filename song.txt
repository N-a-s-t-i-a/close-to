close to you
	
Увеличить шрифт Уменьшить шрифт
Быть с тобой

Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together and
Decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me they long to be
Close to you
